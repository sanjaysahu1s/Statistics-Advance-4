    "A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The main difference between these tests lies in the conditions under which they are applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown. It is based on the t-distribution, which has fatter tails compared to the standard normal (z) distribution. A t-test takes into account the variability within the sample and provides more conservative results compared to a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario for using a t-test:\n",
    "Suppose you want to compare the average heights of two groups of students, a control group and a treatment group. You collect a random sample of 20 students from each group and measure their heights. Since the sample sizes are small and the population standard deviations are unknown, you would use a t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average heights between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) or when the population standard deviation is known. It assumes that the sample data follows a normal distribution. A z-test is more appropriate when dealing with large sample sizes because the standard error of the mean tends to converge to the population standard deviation.\n",

You randomly sample 500 individuals and ask them whether they support the candidate or not. Since the sample size is relatively large, you can assume the sampling distribution of the proportion is approximately normal. In this case, you would use a z-test to assess whether the observed proportion significantly differs from a hypothesized proportion (e.g., 50% support)."

    "\n",
    "1. One-tailed test:\n",
    "In a one-tailed test, the statistical hypothesis is directional, meaning it specifies an expected relationship or difference in a particular direction. The test is used to determine if the sample data provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis in only one direction.\n",

    "Let's say a researcher wants to test the hypothesis that a new medication will increase participants' average response time. The one-tailed null hypothesis would be: \"The new medication has no effect on response time or decreases it.\" The alternative hypothesis would be: \"The new medication increases response time.\" In this case, a one-tailed test would assess whether the data provides evidence of a statistically significant increase in response time.\n",

    "In summary, the choice between a one-tailed or two-tailed test depends on the specific research question and the directional or non-directional nature of the hypothesis being tested.
